# The Ultimate Content Update is Here!
To expedite the transition from 20w14infinite to 1.20.1, this version of the mod creates dummy blocks to allow for migrating a 20w14infinite world to 1.20.1.

While in 20w14infinite, replace the version exclusive blocks with the ones provided with the mod and you'll be able to more easily upgrade to the 1.20.1 version without as much risk of feature loss.

Prominently featured are the Box of Infinite Books, Cursor, A Very Fine Item, An Ant, Footprint, and Netherite Stairs from 20w14infinite. In the background, two An Ant blocks are changing white concrete blocks into black concretes.](https://github.com/cassiancc/Ultimate-Content-Mod/assets/106419675/fe0fe72f-5f81-49a4-9b8b-91a4f4a61794)
