# The Ultimate Content Update is Here!
Not really. This mod is an addon for [Infinite Dimensions](https://modrinth.com/mod/infinite-dimensions) that re-implements content from 20w14infinite into 1.21.1.

As of the 1.21 port, this also includes the formerly separate Ultimate Dimension Pack. In the future, I plan to have the mod automatically generate config files for the dimensions to generate, but for now it's still recommended to use this mod with the ones present in Infinity Plus.

A note: By default, none of these blocks or items (with the exception of Netherite Stairs and Slabs) are craftable. The intent of this mod is to be used alongside a mod that adds infinite dimensions that will generate these blocks.

Prominently featured are the Box of Infinite Books, Cursor, A Very Fine Item, An Ant, Footprint, and Netherite Stairs from 20w14infinite.
