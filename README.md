# The Ultimate Content Update is Here!
Not really. This mod re-implements blocks and items from 20w14infinite into 1.20.1. It works well alongside [Infinite Dimensions](https://modrinth.com/mod/infinite-dimensions).

A note: By default, none of these blocks or items (with the exception of Netherite Stairs and Slabs) are craftable. The intent of this mod is to be used alongside a mod that adds infinite dimensions that will generate these blocks.

Prominently featured are the Box of Infinite Books, Cursor, A Very Fine Item, An Ant, Footprint, and Netherite Stairs from 20w14infinite. In the background, two An Ant blocks are changing white concrete blocks into black concretes.](https://github.com/cassiancc/Ultimate-Content-Mod/assets/106419675/fe0fe72f-5f81-49a4-9b8b-91a4f4a61794)
